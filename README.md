## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

Thanks for checking out this Symphoni Social front-end coding challenge. Please clone this repository and ensure you follow the instructions carefully. This challenge aims to evaluate your file structure, knowledge of components, and state management (ps: don't forget to like and follow ðŸ˜‚).

**To do this challenge, you need a good understanding of React.js, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and Zustand.**

## The challenge

Your challenge is to build out this multi-step form and make it look as close to the design as possible.

Your users should be able to:

- Complete each step of the sequence
- Go back to a previous step to update their selections
- See a summary of their selections on the final step and confirm their order
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page
- Receive form validation messages if:
  - A field has been missed
  - The email address is not formatted correctly
  - A step is submitted, but no selection has been made

If you need support during the challenge, feel free to ask questions to your recruiter.

## Where to find everything

Your task is to build out the project to the designs inside the `/design` folder. You will find both a mobile and a desktop version of the design. 

All the required assets for this project are in the `/assets` folder. The images are already exported for the correct screen size and optimized.

We also include variable and static font files for the required fonts for this project. You can choose to either link to Google Fonts or use the local font files to host the fonts yourself.

There is also a `style-guide.md` file containing the information you'll need, such as color palette and fonts.

## Building your project

Feel free to use any workflow that you feel comfortable with.

1. Initialize your project as a public repository on [GitHub](https://github.com/).
2. Configure your repository to publish your code to a web address.

## Deploying your project

Our recommended hosts are:

- [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/)
- [Vercel](https://vercel.com/)
- [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/)

## Create a custom `README.md`

We strongly recommend overwriting this `README.md` with a custom one. We've provided a template inside the [`README-template.md`](./README-template.md) file in this starter code.

Once you've added your information to the template, delete this file and rename the `README-template.md` file to `README.md`.

## Submitting your solution

Submit your solution on the platform for the recruiters to see. If you're looking for feedback, be sure to ask specific and detailed questions when submitting it.

## Got feedback for us?

We love receiving feedback! We're always looking to improve our recruitment process. So if you have anything you'd like to mention, please email jobs@symphonisocial.com or contact 677606169.

**Have fun building!** ðŸš€
